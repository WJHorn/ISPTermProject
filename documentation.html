         This page shows the full documentation for this project. 
         This includes the architecture, business logic, database design, and any special features.

      <t>Architecture:</t>
      <br>
      <p>
         The general structure of this project is a set of webpages including a welcome screen, 
         a page to log the foods you consume, a page to let the user add foods to the total list of foods, 
         a page to display the foods you have consumed that day, a page to calculate your goal macros for 
         that day, a help page to explain how to use everything, and this page which describes everything 
         on the page.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class = "block">
      <t>Business Logic:</t>
      <br>
      <p>
         The main logic as far as business goes is ease of use for the user. As long as the webpage is 
         easy to use, it will be more likely that people will use it. Although the back end side of things 
         may get a bit complicated, the main idea was making the webpage quite simple and intuitive to use.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class = "block">
      <t>Database Design:</t>
      <br>
      <p>
         For this project, we implemented a total of three SQL database tables within our single database 
         titled "keto_tracker." each of these tables were initialized with the files "Create foods_consumed table(empty).sql", 
         "Create foods_database table.sql", and "CreateMacroTable.sql." The foods_consumed table was used explicitly 
         for storing the foods that had been consumed by the user in that day. The foods_database is the database 
         which allows the user to either add an item to it or choose a food from the database to be consumed.
         The last table is macroVars, which stores the values of the calculated macros to then be used in the main 
         page to compare the users current macros to the users most recent calculated macros.
      </p>

      <t>Special Features:</t>
      <br>
      <p>
         There are two main special features in this webpage. The first one is the macro calculation algorithm. 
         This algorithm was found by researching various sources and finding a general algorithm to calculate 
         first the total amount of calories needed for the day, then finding the percentage of that total for 
         each macro, then calculating the number of grams of each macro per calorie. These values are then 
         stored in the macroVars table.
         The other special feature is the ability to add values to the foods_database table. This is done in its 
         own page, and it does exactly what it sounds like it would.

This is the area that we will put all of the ideas for functions that need to be 
  implemented for the project to work properly and in the end meet our criteria
  for the final result to be excellent.
  
### Part 1

This portion is the most important part, and therefore we need to complete it first.
  These functions are the most basic ones that we need to have the programming 
  running and working at a basic level.

### Part 2

This portion is the par that will mbe needed to complete the project.
  These functions will add the final functionality that we need to finish
  the project so that it is working properly and meets all of the criteria
  for the assignment as a whole, and gives more functional options.

### Part 3

This portion is the less important portion. This part is the extra stuff
  that is not necessary for the assignment, but would allow the program to 
  have even more functionality. This is also the portion where everything 
  would be made to look nice with extra little animations and CSS fluff.
